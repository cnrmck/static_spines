# static_spines

To run this you must have processing installed on your computer as well as java

You can run the file by navigating to the directory with this code in it and running `java -jar ./processing-py.jar`

I also recommend adding these aliases to your .bashrc file (it makes remembering the commands much easier).

```
alias processing='java -jar $PWD/processing-py.jar'
alias psing='processing'
```

If you do so, all you will have to do is run `processing path_to_processing_python_file.pyde` in the directory that contains the processing-py.jar file. You can also use `psing` in place of `processing` if you, like me, are lazy.
